All of the source programs need to follow the following guidelines:


OWNERSHIP

Only the owner of a file can make a change to that file.

All programs that modify, delete, or otherwise change a file MUST
test ownership of the file at the start of the program. If the file
is NOT owned by the user, the program must abort with an error message
that the file is not owned by the user.

Example:

	   #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

		struct stat buf;
		uid_t uid;

		/* see if we own it */
        stat(argv[ct], &buf);
        if ((buf.st_uid) != geteuid()) {
            printf("%s not owner\n",argv[ct++]);
            continue;
        }


		where argv[ct] contains the filename to be modified.



RESPECT THE W FLAG

The following ldir output shows read/write status of a file:

f   2000 rw-  r--       16  file1

The first rw- is owner permissions, the second r-- is permissions
for everyone else (in this case, read only).

In this case, the w flag is set for the owner. This flag MUST 
be checked. When modifying or deleteing a file, the program MUST
test the w flag. If it is NOT present, the program MUST NOT delete
or otherwise modify the file. Only files with the w flag 
can be modified or deleted.

Example:

		/* test if read only */
        if (!(buf.st_mode & S_IWUSR)) {
            printf("%s is read only\n",argv[ct++]);
            continue;	// do not modify this file
        }
