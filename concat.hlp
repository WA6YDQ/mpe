CONCAT file1 file2 [file3] [file4] ...

Add file2 through ... to the end of file1. File2 
et al remains unchanged.

If file 1 does not exist an error will be reported.
If needed, create an empty file using the 'new' command.

Example: new file1

If file2, file3, etc are not readable an error will 
be displayed and the next file in the list will be used.
If no files after file1 exist no change will happen
to file1.
