DELETE [path/name]

Delete one or more files or directories.
Wildcards are expanded by the shell. 

If directory is not empty an error
will be displayed. If name applies
to both a file and directory results
are undefined.

An error occurs if you don't own the file
or directory, or if the file or directory
is marked as read only.

Example: 
delete file1 file2 newdir/test.txt
delete *.txt
