TYPE [path/file]

The type command displays a text file
a page at a time. If the file is smaller
than one page, the file will be displayed 
on one text screen. If the file is larger
a --- MORE --- line will be displayed on the
bottom of the screen. Pressing the enter
key will display another page of text.

If you want to stop the display, press 
the q key and the enter key and the display
will stop and you will be returned to the 
command prompt.
